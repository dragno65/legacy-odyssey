# Legacy Odyssey - Claude Session Context

> **Read this file at the start of every new session.** It contains everything needed to pick up where we left off.

## What Is This Project?

Legacy Odyssey is a **subscription SaaS baby book platform**. Parents use a **React Native mobile app** to fill in their baby's story (milestones, photos, recipes, letters, etc.), and family/friends view the finished book through a **web book viewer** at a custom domain (e.g., `eowynhoperagno.com`).

**Key differentiator:** Users get a **real custom domain** (e.g., `www.janedoe.com`) purchased automatically via Spaceship API during checkout. The domain cost is bundled into the subscription price.

## Domain Purchase Flow (NEW)

The core user flow for domain acquisition:

1. **Landing page** (`landing.ejs`) — User types desired domain name (e.g., "janedoe")
2. **Domain search** (`/api/domains/search`) — Checks availability across .com, .family, .baby, .love, .life, .me via Spaceship bulk API
3. **Smart alternatives** — If taken, suggests variations (prefixes: the/little/baby/our, suffixes: family/book/story, middle names, different TLDs)
4. **$20/yr price cap** — Domains over $20/year are filtered out server-side
5. **Stripe checkout** — Domain selection passed as metadata in checkout session
6. **Async purchase** — After Stripe success, fire-and-forget: register domain → poll status → setup DNS → add to Railway → update family record
7. **Immediate access** — User gets book at slug URL immediately; custom domain activates in 5-30 minutes

### Key Services:
- **spaceshipService.js** — Spaceship REST API wrapper (check availability, bulk check, register domain, poll async ops, setup DNS)
- **domainService.js** — Orchestration layer (search, suggest alternatives, purchase & setup flow)
- **railwayService.js** — Railway GraphQL API (add custom domain to service)
- **stripeService.js** — Modified to accept domain in checkout, create domain_orders row, trigger async purchase

### Database:
- **domain_orders** table tracks lifecycle: pending → registering → registered → dns_setup → active → failed

## Mobile App Screens (Navigation)

The app uses React Navigation with two stacks:

**Auth Stack** (unauthenticated):
- `Login` → LoginScreen.js
- `Signup` → SignupScreen.js

**App Stack** (authenticated or demo mode):
| Route Name | Screen File | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `Dashboard` | DashboardScreen.js | Main hub with cards for each section |
| `ChildInfo` | ChildInfoScreen.js | Baby's name, DOB, weight, length, city, hospital, photo |
| `BeforeArrived` | BeforeScreen.js | Name origin, pregnancy story, cravings, wishes |
| `BirthStory` | BirthStoryScreen.js | Birth narrative, mom/dad photos |
| `ComingHome` | ComingHomeScreen.js | Coming home story, first visitors |
| `Months` | MonthsScreen.js | Grid of Month 1-12 cards |
| `MonthDetail` | MonthDetailScreen.js | Individual month: milestones, favorites, photo |
| `OurFamily` | FamilyScreen.js | List of family members |
| `FamilyMember` | FamilyMemberScreen.js | Add/edit individual family member |
| `YourFirsts` | FirstsScreen.js | First smile, first word, etc. |
| `Celebrations` | CelebrationsScreen.js | Birthday parties, holidays |
| `Letters` | LettersScreen.js | Letters to the child |
| `FamilyRecipes` | RecipesScreen.js | Family recipe collection |
| `TheVault` | VaultScreen.js | File uploads/document storage |
| `Settings` | SettingsScreen.js | Book password, preview, log out |
| `Preview` | PreviewScreen.js | WebView of the book viewer |

---

## Visual Screen Reference System

We created a **visual reference file** (`app-screen-reference.html`) with annotated screenshots of every screen. Each page is numbered and each UI element has a sub-label:

| Page | Screen | Labels |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Login | 1-a (Status Bar) through 1-j (Bottom Tab Bar) |
| 2 | Sign Up | 2-a through 2-j |
| 3 (top) | Dashboard | 3-a through 3-i |
| 3 (bottom) | Dashboard (scrolled) | 3-j through 3-o |
| 4 (top) | Child Info | 4-a through 4-i |
| 4 (bottom) | Child Info (scrolled) | 4-j, 4-k |
| 5 | Before You Arrived | 5-a through 5-i |
| 6 | Birth Story | 6-a through 6-f |
| 7 | Coming Home | 7-a through 7-g |
| 8 | Month by Month | 8-a through 8-g |
| 9 | Month Detail (Month One) | 9-a through 9-g |
| 10 | Our Family | 10-a through 10-e |
| 11 | Your Firsts | 11-a through 11-e |
| 12 | Celebrations | 12-a through 12-f |
| 13 | Letters to You | 13-a through 13-e |
| 14 | Family Recipes | 14-a through 14-f |
| 15 | The Vault | 15-a through 15-h |
| 16 | Settings | 16-a through 16-i |

**Usage:** When the user says something like "change 3-d", that means the Child Info card on the Dashboard. Open `app-screen-reference.html` to see the full visual reference.

## Theme / Design System

```javascript
colors: {
  background: '#faf7f2',   // Warm cream
  dark: '#1a1510',          // Near-black (header bars)
  gold: '#c8a96e',          // Primary accent
  goldLight: '#d4bb8a',
  goldDark: '#b08e4a',
  textPrimary: '#2c2416',
  textSecondary: '#8a7e6b',
  card: '#f0e8dc',          // Card background
  white: '#ffffff',
  error: '#c0392b',
  errorLight: '#f8d7da',
  success: '#27ae60',
  border: '#e0d5c4',
  inputBg: '#ffffff',
  placeholder: '#b8ad9e',
}
```

Fonts: System serif for headings, System sans-serif for body. Web viewer uses Cormorant Garamond + Jost (Google Fonts).

## API Configuration

**Base URL logic** (`mobile/src/api/client.js`):
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL || API_URL || 'https://legacy-odyssey-production-a9d1.up.railway.app'
```

**Auth flow:** JWT Bearer tokens stored in expo-secure-store. Axios interceptor auto-attaches tokens.

**Demo mode:** "Browse Demo" button on login screen sets `isAuthenticated = true` with `isDemo = true` — allows browsing all screens without a real API connection. Data doesn't save in demo mode.

## Current Status (Updated 2026-02-24)

### What's Done:
- Full mobile app built and functional (all 16 screens)
- Express API server built with all routes
- EJS web book viewer built
- Supabase DB core tables created (001_core_tables.sql)
- Railway deployment active and auto-deploying from GitHub
- DNS configured (eowynhoperagno.com + legacyodyssey.com → Railway)
- Visual screen reference system created (app-screen-reference.html)
- APK built and available on Expo
- **Server bugs fixed** (success.ejs rendering, all 5 bugs from deployment plan)
- **Domain search & purchase feature built** (7 new files, 8 modified files)
  - Interactive domain search on landing page
  - Spaceship API integration (availability check, bulk check, registration, DNS)
  - Smart alternative suggestions (prefixes, suffixes, middle names, extra TLDs)
  - $20/year price cap enforcement
  - Stripe checkout integration with domain metadata
  - Async domain purchase orchestration (fire-and-forget after payment)
  - Railway custom domain API integration
- **Spaceship API credentials created** (API key, secret, contact ID)
- **Railway API token created** and all env vars deployed
- **spaceshipService.js fixed** to match real API response format (result field, bulk endpoint)

### What's Remaining:
1. **Run Supabase migration** — `002_domain_orders.sql` needs to be run in SQL Editor
2. **Fund Spaceship wallet** — prepaid balance needed for domain purchases (~$9-12/yr for .com)
3. **Set up Stripe** — create account, get live keys, configure webhook
4. **End-to-end domain test** — test full flow with a real domain once wallet is funded
5. **Continue page-by-page UI/UX review** of the mobile app
6. **Build final production APK**
7. **Push to dragno65 remote** — permission issue needs resolving (Railway deploys from dragno6565-ship-it)

## How to Run Locally

**Server:**
```bash
cd E:/Claude/legacy-odyssey
npm run dev
# Runs on http://localhost:3000
```

**Mobile app (Expo Web for testing):**
```bash
cd E:/Claude/legacy-odyssey/mobile
npx expo start --web --port 8082
# Runs on http://localhost:8082
# Use "Browse Demo" button to skip auth
```

**Serve reference files:**
```bash
cd E:/Claude/legacy-odyssey
python -m http.server 9876
# Access at http://localhost:9876/app-screen-reference.html
```

## Important Notes for Future Sessions

1. **The user's daughter is named Eowyn Hope Ragno** — this is the first real baby book being built
2. **The user prefers direct action** — don't ask unnecessary questions, just do the work
3. **Use the label system** — when discussing UI changes, reference elements by their page-label codes (e.g., "1-e" = email input on login)
4. **Expo Web for screenshots** — use `npx expo start --web --port 8082` with Chrome to view/screenshot the app. Set viewport to 430x932 for mobile simulation
5. **Demo mode** — click "Browse Demo" on the login screen to bypass auth for local testing
6. **The web book viewer is separate** from the mobile app — it's EJS templates served by Express at the book URL
7. **Spaceship API rate limits** — 5 req/domain/300s for availability, 300 req/user/300s for contacts. We use bulk endpoint + in-memory caching (5-min TTL) to mitigate
8. **Domain registration is async** — Spaceship returns 202 + operation ID, poll with /async-operations/{id}
9. **The .env file has all credentials** — never commit it. Use .env.example as template
10. **Railway auto-deploys** from `dragno6565-ship-it/legacy-odyssey` on push to main
